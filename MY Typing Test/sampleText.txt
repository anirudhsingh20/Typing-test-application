    Gross, or Raw WPM (Words Per Minute) is a calculation of exactly how fast you type with no error penalties. The gross typing speed is calculated by taking all words typed and dividing by the time it took to type the words in minutes.

When calculating typing speed, a "word" is any five characters. For instance, "I love keyboarding, don't you?" would be counted as 6 words (30 characters / 5) and not just 5. This makes sense because typing "deinstitutionalization" obviously should count more than typing "my". Spaces, numbers, letters, and punctuation are all included, but any function keys such as Shift or Backspace are not included.

This makes the number of words easy to calculate. Simply count all typed entries and divide by five to get the number of words typed. To give an example, if you typed 200 characters in 1 minute, your net wpm typing speed would be (200 characters / 5) / 1 min = 40 WPM. If you typed 200 characters in 30 seconds your net speed would be (200/5) / 0.5 = 80 WPM.

A Net WPM calculation is preferred for measuring typing speed as opposed to the Gross WPM computation since including mistakes will give a more complete picture of your true typing abilities. However, Gross WPM is used in the calculation of the Net WPM calculation which merits its mention.
